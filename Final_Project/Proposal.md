Name of Project: Plant Assistant

Type of Project: API Client (Option A) 

Brief Description of the Purpose:
The Plant Assistant is designed to be a Python package for people who are interested in plants. It includes comprehensive functions for plant lovers, including, plant identification, care guidance, and personal garden management. This package will utilize data from plant/botanic API and facilitate plant knowledge, care instructions, plant choice recommendations, and so on.

Features and Functionalities:
1.	Plant Encyclopaedia: Acquire the plants’ basic information through the name, including common names, scientific names, characteristics, and general care requirements.
2.	Plant Identification: Identify possible plants based on simple textual descriptions, for instance, plant height, leaf shape, or color. 
3.	Care Assistant: Provide basic care tips for specific plants, includes watering frequency, sunlight requirements, and soil type.
4.	Personal Garden Management: A feature that allows users to log and track their own plants, including care schedules and personal notes.
5.	Personal Garden Recommendation: Provide suggestions for plant choice based on some basic information: experience of planting, areas, available time, color, scent, and so on.

Technical Steps & Challenges:
1.	API Interaction: Handle API requests and responses
2.	Data Transformation/Cleaning: Handling JSON data and transferring it into a Python user-friendly format. Clean and sort the required data for this project.
3.	Function Development: Develop the functions for plant identification, personal garden management, and personal garden recommendation using Python programming. This step would be challenging due to the complexity of functions, especially for plant recommendation. 
4.	Error Handling: Handle basic error input and output instructions.
5.	Package Bundling and Publishing: Bundle the package and publish it through Pypi

Potential Hurdles and Concerns:
The plant data’s amount would affect the accuracy of plant identification, it would be improved when the dataset is more complete, but it would not influence the project’s completeness.
